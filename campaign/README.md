# Coding Challenge Submission

## Technology Stack

- Languages: CSS/HTML/JS
- IDE/Editor: NetBeans/Atom
- SCM: GitHub (Git)

## Development Assumptions

- Static content management (i.e. content does not need to be generated dynamically, thus no application code required)
- Placeholder links are appropriate until proper links are provided
- No graphic resources will be made available besides the screenshot in the assets dir
- Content required for accessibility (e.g. title tag, title attributes and alt tags) that isn't specified in the requirements can be adapted from the provided text
- WC3 standards compliance is required
- UTF-8 encoding allowed
- JavaScript does not need to be used for things that CSS and HTML can do
