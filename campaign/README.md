# Coding Challenge Submission

## Technology Stack

- Languages: CSS/HTML/JS
- Frameworks/templates:
    - CSS reset 2.0 by Eric Meyer (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
- IDE/Editor: NetBeans/Atom
- SCM: GitHub (Git)

## Directory Structure

Webpage content is contained in the `page` subdirectory. The main webpage
is called `index.html`. External sources are located under the `static`
subdirectory. CSS files are located in `css`, while images are stored in
`img`.

```
.
+-- page
    +-- index.html
    +-- static
        +-- css
        +-- img
```

## Development Assumptions

- Static content management (i.e. content does not need to be generated dynamically, thus no application code required)
- Placeholder links are appropriate until proper links are provided
- No graphic resources will be made available besides the screenshot in the assets dir
- Content required for accessibility (e.g. title tag, title attributes and alt tags) that isn't specified in the requirements can be adapted from the provided text
- WC3 standards compliance is required
- UTF-8 encoding allowed
- JavaScript does not need to be used for things that CSS and HTML can do
- Links to preview videos can be pointed to relevant pages on the Stan website

## Known Issues

- Low quality raster graphics due to being taken from provided screenshot
